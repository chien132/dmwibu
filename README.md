Simple website for archiving Vietnamese copypasta, there isn't anything similar in existence so I make one.

Todo: 
- New js scripts for dynamically generated html elements so I don't eventually end up with a raw 6000 lines html file. (done - script now fetch from copypasta.txt file and generate the html file, new copypasta will be put into the .txt file)
- Automation for txt file update to get new copypasta from Google form (not sure how to protect againt spam - on going)
- Use something else beside Jquerry for better looking UI (might just AI - generate some)
- Family friendly domain (I registered ditmewibu.com when I was 17)
- ?????
